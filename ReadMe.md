# Enhance Machine Learning-Based Code Smell Detection Through Hyper-Parameter Optimization

## About
This repository provides an implementation of hyper-parameter optimization for enhance machine learning-based code smell detection, as described in the paper:
**Enhance Machine Learning-Based Code Smell Detection Through Hyper-Parameter Optimization**

To preserve software quality and maintainability, machine learning-based code smell detection has been proposed and the results are promising. However, there are a lack of studies on applying hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) to improve the efficiency of code smell detection. Moreover, we found that there are a limited number of previous works indicating the effect of HPO to the code smell detection. 

This work proposed an enhanced version of machine learning-based code smell detection by applying hyper-parameter optimization techniques.
